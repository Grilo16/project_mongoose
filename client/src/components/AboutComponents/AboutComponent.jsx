        <h1>About Project Mongoose</h1>
        <p>
        The aim of The Ear-Replaceable Biology App (Code name Projet Mongoose) was to create a full stack learning
        site from scratch. Since it would be built from the ground up we could decide on the structure and purpose
        of the app based on user stories and developer vision. It would be scaleable for its features and be designed
        in such a way that it would be friendly and accesible for the users and contributing future developers.
        We hope you enjoy, and please feel free to leave comments in our comments page!

          Here we have set out a list of features that we would have liked to
          have had or work on in the future. The list is not exhaustive but the
          general gist is:
          <ul>
            <li>User log out (Sorry Alex!)</li>
            <li>More interactive organs page</li>
            <li>Other features pages ( Geography , Maths , Coding etc)</li>
            <li>Search entire application</li>
            <li>Multiple choice quiz questions</li>
            
          </ul>
